# Portfolio
# Description
This is the first project of the Udacity/Google Nanodegree Front-End Developer program.  The responsiveness of the images is not exactly where I want it, but it looks ok on most emulated devices.  This will be my portfolio to add to and work on while I continue to gain experience and skills in this program.
